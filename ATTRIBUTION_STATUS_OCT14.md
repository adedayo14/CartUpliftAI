# Attribution System Status - Oct 14, 2025

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Webhook 401 Errors - SOLVED
**Problem**: Webhook logs showed 401 unauthorized errors with HMAC validation failures
**Root Cause**: Duplicate webhook subscription in Shopify Admin with mismatched API secret
**Solution**: Deleted duplicate webhook from Shopify Admin UI
**Status**: ✅ Webhooks now working correctly - logs show "✅ Order webhook complete in 14ms"

### 2. Dashboard Showing £0 Revenue - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**Problem**: Dashboard displays "Revenue from AI Recommendations £0.00" despite 16 orders and webhooks working
**Root Cause Chain**:
1. Theme extension has tracking code but Vercel hasn't deployed `api.track-recommendations.tsx` yet
2. Theme extension calls endpoint → gets 404 → no `ml_recommendation_served` events saved
3. Webhook processes orders successfully but finds 0 ml_recommendation_served events to match
4. No attribution records created in `RecommendationAttribution` table
5. Dashboard correctly queries attribution table but it's empty → shows £0

**Solution**: Wait for Vercel to deploy tracking endpoint OR manually trigger deployment

## 📊 CURRENT SYSTEM STATE

### Database
- **TrackingEvent**: 426 events (impressions/clicks working ✅)
- **RecommendationAttribution**: 0 records (empty because no ml_recommendation_served events)

### Webhooks
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly, no more 401s
- **Response times**: 14ms - 95ms (healthy)
- **Flow**: ORDERS_CREATE → queries ml_recommendation_served events → matches purchased products → creates attribution

### Theme Extension (cart-uplift v28)
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed to Shopify with tracking code
- **Tracking method**: `trackRecommendationsServed()` at lines 6016, 6029, 6037
- **Target endpoint**: `/apps/cart-uplift/api/track-recommendations`
- **Issue**: Endpoint returns 404 because Vercel hasn't deployed it yet

### Vercel Deployment
- **Last deployment**: 2025-10-14 14:42:43 UTC
- **Commits missing**:
  - d4793d5 (13:53): Created api.track-recommendations.tsx
  - 4c03746 (14:30): Theme extension bundle with tracking
  - 44d7da3 (15:00): Deployment trigger
  - ecaf599 (15:01): Webhook reset endpoints
- **Blocker**: Auto-deploy hasn't triggered yet

## 🔄 ATTRIBUTION FLOW

### Complete Flow (When Working)
```
1. Customer views cart with recommendations
   └─> Theme extension: trackRecommendationsServed()
       └─> POST /apps/cart-uplift/api/track-recommendations
           └─> Saves TrackingEvent with event='ml_recommendation_served'
               └─> metadata.recommendationIds = [product IDs]

2. Customer completes purchase
   └─> Shopify fires ORDERS_CREATE webhook
       └─> App queries ml_recommendation_served events (last 7 days)
           └─> Matches purchased product IDs against recommendationIds
               └─> Creates RecommendationAttribution records
                   └─> Dashboard displays attributed revenue
```

### Current Broken Point
```
1. Customer views cart with recommendations
   └─> Theme extension: trackRecommendationsServed()
       └─> POST /apps/cart-uplift/api/track-recommendations
           └─> ❌ 404 Not Found (endpoint not deployed)
               └─> No events saved

2. Customer completes purchase
   └─> Webhook processes successfully ✅
       └─> Queries for ml_recommendation_served events
           └─> Finds 0 events
               └─> No matches, no attribution created
                   └─> Dashboard shows £0
```

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

### 1. Deploy Tracking Endpoint (BLOCKING)
**Options**:
- Wait for Vercel auto-deploy (unpredictable timing)
- Manually trigger deployment via Vercel dashboard
- Use Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod`

### 2. Verify Endpoint After Deploy
```bash
curl -X POST https://cartuplift.vercel.app/apps/cart-uplift/api/track-recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"shop":"test","sessionId":"test","anchorProducts":[],"recommendedProducts":["123"]}'
```
Expected: `{"success": true}` (not 404)

### 3. Test Storefront Tracking
- Hard refresh storefront (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Add product to cart, open drawer
- Check browser console for: "📈 Tracking ml_recommendation_served"
- Check Vercel logs for POST to `/api/track-recommendations` with 200 response

### 4. Verify Events in Database
- Check Vercel logs for: "📈 Saving ml_recommendation_served event"
- Dashboard loader should log: "ML recommendation events: X" (where X > 0)

### 5. Place Test Order
- Add recommended product to cart
- Complete checkout
- Check webhook logs for: "✅ MATCH! Products X were recommended"
- Check logs for: "💰 Attribution complete: saved X records"
- Dashboard should show attributed revenue > £0

## 🐛 UNRELATED ISSUES (Non-Critical)

### 302 Redirects in Logs
**What**: App loading redirects during embedded app authentication
**Status**: Normal Shopify App Bridge behavior, not an error

### 410 Gone Errors
**What**: Session validation failures on `/app` route
**Status**: Normal for expired/invalid sessions, app handles gracefully

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Attribution system will be fully operational when:
1. ✅ Webhooks process without 401 errors
2. ⏳ Tracking endpoint deployed and returns 200
3. ⏳ ml_recommendation_served events saved to database
4. ⏳ Webhook creates attribution records for purchases
5. ⏳ Dashboard displays attributed revenue > £0

**Current Status**: 1/5 complete
**Blocking Issue**: Vercel deployment lag
**ETA**: Minutes to hours depending on deployment method
