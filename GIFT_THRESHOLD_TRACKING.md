# Gift Threshold Tracking Implementation

## Overview
Comprehensive gift threshold tracking has been added to the dashboard analytics, providing merchants with full visibility into how gift incentives affect order values and customer behavior. This matches the completeness of the existing free shipping tracking system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Data Collection (Lines 214-268)
- **Gift Threshold Parsing**: Parses JSON gift thresholds from settings
- **Order Tracking**: Tracks orders reaching gift thresholds vs those that don't
- **AOV Calculations**: Calculates average order value with/without gift eligibility
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of orders reaching gift thresholds
- **AOV Lift**: Percentage increase in order value when gifts are earned
- **Per-Threshold Breakdown**: Statistics for each individual gift tier

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
- `ordersReachingGifts` - Count of orders qualifying for gifts
- `ordersNotReachingGifts` - Count below threshold
- `avgAOVWithGift` - Average order value for gift-qualifying orders
- `avgAOVWithoutGift` - Average order value for non-qualifying orders
- `giftConversionRate` - Percentage reaching threshold
- `giftAOVLift` - Percentage AOV increase
- `giftRevenue` - Total revenue from gift-qualifying orders
- `giftThresholdBreakdown` - Array with per-threshold stats

### 2. UI Display (Lines 1016-1048)
Three new metric cards display when gift gating is enabled:

**Gift AOV Boost Card**
- Shows percentage increase in AOV when gifts are earned
- Compares AOV with gifts vs without
- Example: "+15.2% | £85.50 vs £74.20 without gifts"

**Gift Achievement Rate Card**
- Shows percentage of orders earning gifts
- Displays order counts
- Example: "35.2% | 142 of 403 orders earn gifts"

**Gift-Driven Revenue Card**
- Shows total revenue from gift-qualifying orders
- Displays percentage of total revenue
- Example: "£12,141 | 43.2% of total revenue"

### 3. Smart Insights (Lines 1187-1233)
Four intelligent insights help merchants optimize gift thresholds:

**Low Achievement Warning** (< 10%)
- Alerts when few customers reach thresholds
- Suggests lowering thresholds to increase engagement
- Actionable: "Review gift threshold in settings"

**High Achievement Attention** (> 60%)
- Alerts when most orders easily earn gifts
- Suggests raising thresholds or adding tiers
- Actionable: "Test higher gift thresholds"

**AOV Lift Success** (> 20%)
- Celebrates when gifts effectively drive larger orders
- Encourages more prominent gift promotion
- Actionable: "Promote gift tiers more prominently"

**Gift Tier Gap Detection**
- Identifies large drop-offs between gift tiers
- Suggests adjusting threshold spacing
- Actionable: "Review gift tier spacing"

### 4. CSV Export Integration (Lines 827-853)
Added comprehensive gift data to full dashboard export:

**Gift Threshold Metrics Section:**
- Gift Achievement Rate
- Orders Reaching/Not Reaching Gifts
- AOV With/Without Gift
- Gift AOV Lift percentage
- Gift-Driven Revenue total

**Per-Threshold Breakdown Table:**
- Each threshold amount
- Orders reached at each level
- Percentage reached at each level

### 5. Error Handling (Lines 676-685)
Safe fallback values prevent crashes when:
- Gift gating is disabled
- No gift thresholds are configured
- Database queries fail
- Settings are incomplete

## How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **Settings Check**: Reads `enableGiftGating` and `giftThresholds` from settings
2. **Threshold Parsing**: Parses JSON array of gift configurations
3. **Order Analysis**: Loops through orders to check if they reach thresholds
4. **Metric Calculation**: Computes conversion rates, AOV comparisons, per-tier stats
5. **UI Display**: Shows metrics in cards when gift gating is enabled
6. **Insights Generation**: Analyzes metrics to provide optimization recommendations
7. **Export**: Includes all gift data in CSV exports

### Example Gift Thresholds JSON
```json
[
  {
    "threshold": 50,
    "productId": "gid://shopify/Product/123",
    "productTitle": "Free Tote Bag"
  },
  {
    "threshold": 100,
    "productId": "gid://shopify/Product/456",
    "productTitle": "Premium Gift Set"
  }
]
```

### Calculation Logic
```typescript
// Find lowest threshold for conversion tracking
const lowestThreshold = Math.min(...giftThresholds.map(g => g.threshold));

// Track orders reaching threshold
orders.forEach(order => {
  const orderTotal = parseFloat(order.node.totalPriceSet.shopMoney.amount);
  if (orderTotal >= lowestThreshold) {
    ordersReachingGifts += 1;
    giftRevenue += orderTotal;
  }
});

// Calculate conversion rate
giftConversionRate = totalOrders > 0 ? (ordersReachingGifts / totalOrders) * 100 : 0;

// Calculate AOV lift
giftAOVLift = avgAOVWithoutGift > 0 ? 
  ((avgAOVWithGift - avgAOVWithoutGift) / avgAOVWithoutGift) * 100 : 0;

// Per-threshold breakdown
giftThresholdBreakdown = giftThresholds.map(gift => ({
  threshold: gift.threshold,
  ordersReached: orders.filter(o => parseFloat(o.node.totalPriceSet.shopMoney.amount) >= gift.threshold).length,
  percentReached: totalOrders > 0 ? (ordersReached / totalOrders) * 100 : 0
}));
```

## Merchant Benefits

### Visibility
- See exactly how many customers earn gifts
- Understand the AOV impact of gift incentives
- Track performance of each gift tier

### Optimization
- Identify if thresholds are too high (low achievement)
- Identify if thresholds are too low (high achievement)
- Detect gaps between gift tiers that reduce engagement
- Celebrate successful gift strategies

### Reporting
- Export gift performance data for analysis
- Share results with stakeholders
- Track changes over time

## Integration Points

### Settings Configuration
Reads from `Settings` model:
- `enableGiftGating` - Feature toggle
- `giftThresholds` - JSON array of threshold configs

### Database Queries
Uses existing Shopify order data:
- Order total amounts
- Order counts
- Timeframe filtering (7d, 30d, 90d, all)

### Dashboard Display
Shows when:
- Gift gating is enabled (`enableGiftGating = true`)
- Gift thresholds are configured (non-empty array)
- Order data is available

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Low Achievement (< 10%)
- Threshold: £150
- AOV: £60
- Result: Warning insight + suggestion to lower threshold

### Scenario 2: High Achievement (> 60%)
- Threshold: £30
- AOV: £85
- Result: Attention insight + suggestion to raise threshold

### Scenario 3: Strong AOV Lift (> 20%)
- Gift orders: £95 average
- Non-gift orders: £70 average
- Result: Success insight + promote gifts more

### Scenario 4: Tier Gap
- Tier 1 (£50): 45% reach
- Tier 2 (£150): 8% reach
- Result: Info insight + adjust tier spacing

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Queries
- Uses existing order fetch (no additional database calls)
- Single pass through orders for all calculations
- Minimal memory overhead (tracked counters only)

### Conditional Display
- Only shows metrics when gift gating is enabled
- Gracefully handles missing data
- No performance impact when feature is disabled

### TypeScript Safety
- Null checks on all threshold operations
- Type guards for array filtering
- Safe fallback values in error scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- [ ] Quick Wins banner for gift optimization (like free shipping)
- [ ] Gift tier comparison chart (visual breakdown)
- [ ] A/B test gift threshold changes
- [ ] Historical trend tracking (achievement rate over time)
- [ ] Product-specific gift performance (which gifts drive most orders)
- [ ] Customer segments analysis (who reaches each tier)

## Files Modified

  - Loader data collection
  - Return object fields
  - Error fallback
  - UI metric cards
