# Quick ML Migration - Vercel Production

## Your Setup âœ…
- Project: **cartuplift** on Vercel
- GitHub: https://github.com/adedayo14/CartUpliftAI.git
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL (connected via Vercel env vars)
- Status: Code deployed, **migration will run on next deployment**

## âœ… READY TO DEPLOY

I've updated your `package.json` vercel-build script to use `prisma db push` which will:
1. Generate Prisma client
2. Push schema changes to your Neon database (creates the 3 ML tables)
3. Build your Remix app

## Run Migration - Single Command

Just push the updated package.json and Vercel will auto-deploy with migration:

```bash
git add package.json QUICK_MIGRATION.md
git commit -m "feat: auto-migrate ML tables on vercel deploy"
git push origin main
```

**That's it!** Vercel will:
1. Detect the push
2. Start building
3. Run `prisma db push` (creates ML tables)
4. Deploy your app

## Monitor the Deployment

1. **Watch Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select: cartuplift
   - Click: Deployments tab
   - Watch the build logs in real-time

2. **Look for These Log Messages**
   ```
   Running "prisma generate"...
   Running "prisma db push"...
   
   ðŸš€  Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema.
   âœ” Generated Prisma Client
   ```

3. **Verify Success**
   After deployment completes (~2-3 minutes), the ML tables will be created automatically.

## What Gets Created

Three new tables in your Neon database:
- âœ… `MLUserProfile` - User behavior tracking
- âœ… `MLProductSimilarity` - Product recommendation cache
- âœ… `MLDataRetentionJob` - GDPR compliance

## After Deployment

Test your ML endpoints:

```bash
# Your Vercel app URL (replace with actual)
APP_URL="https://cartuplift.vercel.app"

# Test content recommendations
curl -X POST $APP_URL/api/ml/content-recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"shop":"your-shop.myshopify.com","product_ids":["123"],"privacy_level":"basic"}'

# Test popular recommendations  
curl -X POST $APP_URL/api/ml/popular-recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"shop":"your-shop.myshopify.com","privacy_level":"basic"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

**If build fails:**
1. Check Vercel build logs for Prisma errors
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is set in Vercel env vars
3. Check Neon database is active and accessible

**If tables aren't created:**
- Vercel might need DATABASE_URL reconnection
- Check Settings â†’ Environment Variables â†’ DATABASE_URL
- Ensure it starts with `postgresql://`

## Next Steps After Successful Deploy

1. âœ… ML tables created
2. âœ… ML endpoints live
3. âœ… Settings page shows real order count
4. ðŸ”œ Test with your Shopify store
5. ðŸ”œ Monitor tracking events
6. ðŸ”œ Setup data retention cron job
