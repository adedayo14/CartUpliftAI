## üìù KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Product Assignment UI** - Currently uses button placeholder. Full Shopify ResourcePicker would require app bridge integration.

2. **Category Selection** - Backend supports it, but full UI for selecting products from collection needs additional work.

3. **Discount Codes** - Bundles currently use inline pricing. Auto-applying Shopify discount codes would require checkout script integration (Shopify Plus feature).

4. **Bundle Integrity** - Items can be removed from cart individually. To enforce "all or nothing," would need custom cart logic.

5. **Variant Selection** - Currently uses first variant. For products with multiple variants, would need variant selector in bundle.

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS (Post-Testing)

1. **Test thoroughly** with above checklist
2. **Fix any bugs** discovered
3. **Gather feedback** from users
4. **Iterate** on UI/UX
5. **Add analytics** tracking
6. **Performance optimization**
7. **A/B testing** different bundle types

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server logs (Vercel dashboard)
3. Verify database migration completed
4. Test API endpoints directly (Postman/curl)
5. Review this testing guide

**All code is ready to deploy and test!** üéâ
