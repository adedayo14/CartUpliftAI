# Express Checkout Setting Migration

## ✅ Complete: Moved to Theme Embed

### What Was Done

**Before:**
- Express Checkout setting in app settings page (`/app/settings`)
- Saved to database but **not actually used** by the cart
- Confusing for merchants (setting didn't work)

**After:**
- Express Checkout setting in theme embed (`app-embed.liquid`)
- Appears in Shopify theme editor under "Advanced features"
- **Actually controls** whether express checkout buttons appear
- Real-time preview when toggling

---

## How It Works Now

### In Theme Editor
Merchants will see:
```
📦 Cart Uplift (App Embed Settings)
  ├─ Cart Behavior
  ├─ Incentives & Progress
  ├─ Product Recommendations  
  ├─ Quick Actions
  │   ├─ Discount link
  │   └─ Order notes link
  └─ Advanced Features
      └─ ☑ Enable express checkout buttons
          Show PayPal, Shop Pay, and other express checkout options in cart
```

### Setting Injection
```liquid
enableExpressCheckout: {{ block.settings.enable_express_checkout | json }}
```

This gets passed to `window.CartUpliftSettings` which the cart JavaScript reads.

### Cart JavaScript Usage
```javascript
// Shows express checkout section only if enabled
return this.settings.enableExpressCheckout ? this.getExpressCheckoutHTML() : '';

// Initializes dynamic payment buttons
if (!this.settings || this.settings.enableExpressCheckout === false) return;
```

✅ **No confusion** - Setting actually does something

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **`extensions/cart-uplift/blocks/app-embed.liquid`**
   - Added `enable_express_checkout` to schema (line ~557)
   - Injected setting into JavaScript (line ~88)
   - Default: `true`

2. **`app/routes/app.settings.tsx`**
   - Removed "Advanced Cart Features" card entirely
   - Cleaned up settings page (less clutter)

### No Breaking Changes
- Cart JavaScript already had the logic
- Default is `true` (matches previous behavior)
- Setting name unchanged (`enableExpressCheckout`)
- No database migration needed

## What Express Checkout Does

When **enabled** (default):
- Shows dynamic payment buttons in cart
- Displays: PayPal, Shop Pay, Google Pay, Apple Pay (based on what's configured)
- Buttons appear in cart footer above main checkout button
- Fast checkout for returning customers

When **disabled**:
- Hides all express checkout buttons
- Only shows main "Checkout" button
- Cleaner look if merchant doesn't use these payment methods

---

## App Settings Page Status

Now shows:
1. ✅ **Quick Setup** - Info about analytics (always-on)
2. ✅ **AI-Powered Recommendations** - ML settings (placeholder)
3. ✅ **Text & Copy Customization** - Button labels
4. ❌ **Advanced Cart Features** - REMOVED (was just Express Checkout)

All functional settings now in theme editor where they belong!

---

## Summary

This moves Express Checkout setting from a non-functional app database setting to a functional theme embed setting. Merchants now control it where they customize their cart, see real-time previews, and it actually works.

**Status**: ✅ Complete and pushed to main
**Breaking Changes**: None (backward compatible)
**Merchant Action Required**: None (default is enabled)
