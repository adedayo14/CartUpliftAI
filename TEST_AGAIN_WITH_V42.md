# ⚠️ YOUR FIRST TEST USED OLD CODE - TEST AGAIN NOW!

**Date:** October 15, 2025 - 1:35 PM  
**Status:** ✅ Correct version NOW deployed (v42)

---

## 🚨 WHAT WENT WRONG WITH YOUR FIRST TEST

### Your Test Results (Version 41 - OLD CODE):
```
Calf Sole Sneakers:
  Impressions: 2
  Clicks: 10
  Click Rate: 500% ❌ IMPOSSIBLE

The Letterman:
  Impressions: 1
  Clicks: 7
  Click Rate: 700% ❌ IMPOSSIBLE

Overall: 17 clicks from 10 views = 170% CTR ❌ IMPOSSIBLE
```

### Why This Happened:
- You tested at **1:21 PM**
- But version 41 was deployed at **11:23 AM** (BEFORE we fixed deduplication)
- Version 41 did NOT have the tracking fixes
- So you got the same old duplicate tracking bug

### What Just Happened:
1. ✅ Deployed **version 42** with ACTUAL deduplication fixes
2. ✅ Cleared all corrupted tracking data (33 bad events deleted)
3. ✅ Database now clean and ready for proper test

## 📋 EXACT TEST STEPS

### What You'll Do:
1. **Open your store** (https://sectionappblocks.myshopify.com)
2. **Add Snow Boots to cart** (your original product)
3. **Open cart drawer** 
   - Look at recommendations shown
   - Count how many products you see (let's say 6)
4. **Scroll right and click The Letterman ONCE**
   - Browser console should show: `📊 Tracking click for product [ID]`
5. **Add it to cart**
6. **Close cart drawer**
7. **Re-open cart drawer** ← THIS IS THE KEY TEST
   - Browser console should show: `🛡️ Skipping duplicate impression` for all products
   - NO new impressions should be logged
8. **Click The Letterman again** ← SHOULD NOT COUNT
   - Browser console should show: `🛡️ Skipping duplicate click`
9. **Scroll and click Calf Sole Sneakers ONCE**
   - Browser console should show: `📊 Tracking click for product [ID]`
10. **Add it to cart**
11. **Complete checkout**

### What You Should See:

**If 6 products were shown:**
```
Impressions: 6 (one per product, logged on first cart open)
Clicks: 2 (The Letterman + Calf Sole Sneakers, one each)
Click Rate: 33.3% (2 ÷ 6 = 33.3%) ✅ REALISTIC
```

**The Letterman:**
```
Impressions: 1 (shown once)
Clicks: 1 (clicked once, second click ignored)
Click Rate: 100% ✅ MAXIMUM POSSIBLE

## 📝 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Deduplication Key Format:
```
impression_12345_sess_1729012345_abc123
click_67890_sess_1729012345_abc123
```

### Storage:
- **Client:** sessionStorage Set (`trackedEvents`)
- **Server:** PostgreSQL TrackingEvent table

### Session Lifetime:
- Starts when you first visit store
- Persists across page refreshes
- Resets when browser tab is closed
- Format: `sess_[timestamp]_[random]`

### What's Deduplicated:
- ✅ Impressions (view same product multiple times in same session)
- ✅ Clicks (click same product multiple times in same session)
- ❌ NOT deduplicated: Different sessions (close browser, come back = new session)

This is CORRECT behavior - a customer returning days later should count as new impressions/clicks!
