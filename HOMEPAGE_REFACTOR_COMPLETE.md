- Cluttered layout with mini feature cards
- Unclear navigation path
- Mixed priorities between setup and exploration

### After
- **Clean Hero Section**: Welcome message + value proposition
- **Prominent CTA**: "Enable Theme Embed" button (primary action)
- **Clear Feature Overview**: 4-card grid explaining what the app does
- **Quick Access Cards**: Direct navigation to Dashboard and Settings
- **Simple Quick Start**: 3-step numbered guide
- **Smart Hints**: Warning banner if settings not configured

## Key Features

### 1. Hero Section
- Welcome headline with emoji
- Clear value proposition
- Info banner explaining first setup step
- Two action buttons:
  - **Enable Theme Embed** (primary) - Opens theme editor in new tab
  - **Configure Settings** (secondary) - Navigates to settings

### 2. What Cart Uplift Does (Feature Grid)
Four key capabilities highlighted:
- ü§ñ AI Product Recommendations
- üìä Free Shipping Progress
- üéÅ Gift with Purchase
- üìà Performance Analytics

### 3. Quick Access Cards
Two prominent cards for navigation:
- **Analytics Dashboard** (primary button) - View revenue metrics
- **App Settings** (default button) - Manage configuration

Each card shows:
- Icon indicator
- Clear description
- Call-to-action button

### 4. Quick Start Guide
Numbered 3-step process:
1. Enable the app embed in theme editor
2. Configure settings (ML, thresholds, gifts)
3. Monitor performance in Dashboard

### 5. Smart Hints
- Warning banner appears if settings not yet configured
- Tip: Reminds users to configure settings first

## Navigation Structure

### NavMenu (Visible in Top Bar)
- **Home** ‚Üí Landing page (this refactored page)
- **Dashboard** ‚Üí Analytics and performance tracking
- **Settings** ‚Üí ML controls, text customization, feature toggles

All links are visible and functional via Shopify App Bridge NavMenu component in `app.tsx`.

## Technical Details

### File: `app/routes/app._index.tsx`
- **Loader simplified**: Returns `{ shop, currentThemeId, hasSettings }`
- **No progress tracking**: Removed complex setupSteps calculation
- **Clean component**: Single focused component with clear sections
- **Proper routing**: Uses `navigate()` for internal links, `target="_top"` for theme editor

### Dependencies
- Shopify Polaris components (Page, Card, Button, BlockStack, etc.)
- App Bridge React (TitleBar, NavMenu)
- Remix routing (useNavigate, useLoaderData)
- Prisma (settings check)

### Styling Approach
- Polaris design system (no custom CSS files needed)
- Inline styles for numbered step circles (minimal, semantic)
- Responsive Grid layout (adapts to mobile/desktop)

## User Flow

1. **Merchant installs app** ‚Üí Sees clean welcome page
2. **Clicks "Enable Theme Embed"** ‚Üí Opens theme editor in new tab
3. **Enables app embed** ‚Üí Toggles "Cart Uplift - Smart Cart" ON
4. **Returns to app** ‚Üí Clicks "Configure Settings"
5. **Sets up ML/thresholds/gifts** ‚Üí Saves configuration
6. **Monitors performance** ‚Üí Uses Dashboard to track ROI

## Benefits

- **Clear onboarding**: Merchants know exactly what to do first
- **Reduced confusion**: No complex progress tracking or setup state
- **Better navigation**: Subpages (Dashboard, Settings) clearly visible
- **Professional UX**: Clean, modern design with Shopify Polaris
- **Mobile-friendly**: Responsive grid adapts to screen sizes

## Next Steps

The homepage is production-ready. Key considerations:
- Settings page has comprehensive ML/AI controls (keep as-is)
- Dashboard has full analytics suite (revenue, AOV, products, etc.)
- Theme editor link correctly breaks out of iframe context
- Navigation is always visible via top NavMenu
