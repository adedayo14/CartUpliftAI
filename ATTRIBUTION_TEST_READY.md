## 🔄 Complete Attribution Flow

```
1. CUSTOMER VIEWS CART
   └─> Cart drawer opens with products
       └─> Theme extension generates recommendations
           └─> trackRecommendationsServed() called
               └─> POST /apps/cart-uplift/api/track-recommendations
                   ├─> Auth: Shopify app proxy validates request
                   ├─> Save: TrackingEvent record created
                   │   ├─> event: 'ml_recommendation_served'
                   │   ├─> productId: anchorProducts[0]
                   │   ├─> sessionId: browser session ID
                   │   └─> metadata: { recommendationIds: ["123", "456", "789"] }
                   └─> Response: { success: true }

2. CUSTOMER ADDS RECOMMENDED PRODUCT
   └─> Product ID 456 added to cart (was in recommendations)

3. CUSTOMER COMPLETES CHECKOUT
   └─> Shopify fires ORDERS_CREATE webhook
       └─> App receives webhook at /webhooks/orders/create
           ├─> Extracts: purchasedProductIds = ["456", "999"]
           ├─> Queries: TrackingEvent.findMany({ event: 'ml_recommendation_served' })
           ├─> Finds: 1 event with metadata.recommendationIds = ["123", "456", "789"]
           ├─> Matches: Product 456 is in recommendationIds ✅
           ├─> Calculates: attributedRevenue for product 456
           └─> Saves: RecommendationAttribution record
               ├─> productId: "456"
               ├─> orderId: "5820234752321"
               ├─> orderValue: 2500 (£25.00)
               ├─> attributedRevenue: 1500 (£15.00)
               └─> recommendationEventIds: ["tracking_event_123"]

4. DASHBOARD UPDATES
   └─> Loader queries: SUM(attributedRevenue) FROM RecommendationAttribution
       └─> Displays: "Revenue from AI Recommendations: £15.00" ✅

## 🧪 Test Execution Plan

### Test Order #1: Basic Attribution

**Objective**: Verify end-to-end tracking and attribution

**Steps**:
1. Open storefront: `https://sectionappblocks.myshopify.com`
2. Add any product to cart
3. Open cart drawer (recommendations should display)
4. **Note**: Check browser console for `📈 Tracking ml_recommendation_served`
5. Add a recommended product to cart
6. Complete checkout
7. **Verify**: Check Vercel logs

**Expected Vercel Logs**:
```
[15:XX:XX] 📈 [Client-side] Saving ml_recommendation_served event
[15:XX:XX] ✅ [Client-side] ml_recommendation_served event saved successfully
[15:XX:XX] 📊 Order details: { customerId: '...', orderNumber: 1234, orderValue: 2500 }
[15:XX:XX] 🛍️ Purchased products: ['456', '999']
[15:XX:XX] 📦 Found 1 recommendation events
[15:XX:XX] ✅ MATCH! Products 456 were recommended
[15:XX:XX] 💰 Attribution complete: saved 1 records
```

**Expected Dashboard**:
- "Revenue from AI Recommendations" > £0.00 ✅
- Recent Orders table shows attributed order

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### 1. Check Tracking Events in Database
```bash
# Via Prisma Studio or Vercel logs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TrackingEvent WHERE event = 'ml_recommendation_served';
# Should return > 0 after cart drawer opens
```

### 2. Check Attribution Records
```bash
# Via Prisma Studio or Vercel logs
SELECT * FROM RecommendationAttribution ORDER BY createdAt DESC;
# Should show records after test order completes
```

### 3. Monitor Real-Time Logs
- Go to: https://vercel.com/your-project/logs
- Filter for: `/api/track-recommendations` and `/webhooks/orders/create`
- Look for: ✅ success messages

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: No tracking event saved
**Symptoms**: No `📈 [Client-side] Saving` log  
**Checks**:
- Browser console: Look for fetch errors
- Network tab: Check `/apps/cart-uplift/api/track-recommendations` response
- Vercel logs: Check for 401 Unauthorized errors

**Fix**: Verify Shopify app proxy is configured correctly in shopify.app.toml

### Issue: Webhook doesn't find events
**Symptoms**: `📦 Found 0 recommendation events`  
**Checks**:
- Database: Query TrackingEvent table for ml_recommendation_served events
- Timing: Ensure checkout happens within 7 days of cart view
- Shop match: Verify shop field matches in both tables

**Fix**: Check database connection and TrackingEvent creation

### Issue: No product matches
**Symptoms**: `No matches for this event`  
**Checks**:
- Webhook logs: Compare purchased IDs vs recommendationIds
- Data types: Verify both are strings ("123" not 123)
- Product IDs: Ensure Shopify product IDs are consistent

**Fix**: Check theme extension product ID extraction logic

### Issue: Dashboard still shows £0
**Symptoms**: Attribution records exist but dashboard shows £0  
**Checks**:
- Database: Verify RecommendationAttribution.attributedRevenue is populated
- Dashboard loader: Check query logic for SUM calculation
- Date range: Verify loader queries correct time period

**Fix**: Check dashboard query in admin.dashboard.tsx loader

## 📊 Success Metrics

After test order, verify:

1. ✅ **TrackingEvent table**: 1+ ml_recommendation_served event
2. ✅ **RecommendationAttribution table**: 1+ attribution record  
3. ✅ **Dashboard metric**: "Revenue from AI Recommendations" > £0
4. ✅ **Webhook logs**: No errors, matches found
5. ✅ **Browser console**: Tracking confirmed

## 🎯 Production Readiness

### Code Quality
- ✅ Error handling in all tracking functions
- ✅ Logging for debugging and monitoring
- ✅ CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Authentication on all endpoints

### Performance
- ✅ Async tracking (doesn't block UI)
- ✅ 7-day window for event lookup (not full history)
- ✅ Indexed database queries
- ✅ Best-effort tracking (failures don't break checkout)

### Data Privacy
- ✅ Optional customerId (respects privacy settings)
- ✅ SessionId for attribution without PII
- ✅ Product-level attribution (not customer-specific)

### Monitoring
- ✅ Console logs for all major operations
- ✅ Error logging for failures
- ✅ Success confirmations
- ✅ Vercel log aggregation

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Place test order to verify attribution
2. **Short-term**: Monitor real customer orders for attribution accuracy
3. **Medium-term**: Add dashboard alerts for tracking failures
4. **Long-term**: Implement ML feedback loop for recommendation improvement
