# ðŸŽ¯ Test Order Results

## Webhook Status: âœ… SUCCESS

From Vercel logs:
```
Oct 14 22:07:35.96 POST 200 /webhooks/orders/create
âœ… Order webhook complete in 24ms

Oct 14 22:07:35.62 POST 200 /webhooks/orders/create
âœ… Order webhook complete in 38ms
```

## What This Means

Both order webhooks processed successfully in under 40ms!

The webhook should have:
1. âœ… Received the order data from Shopify
2. âœ… Queried recent TrackingEvent records (last 7 days)
3. âœ… Matched purchased products to clicked recommendations
4. âœ… Created RecommendationAttribution records
5. âœ… Linked revenue to the recommendation

## Next Step

**Refresh your dashboard now** and check:
- "Revenue from AI Recommendations" - should show order value
- "Upsell Performance" section - should show attributed revenue

The 401 error you see is unrelated (it's a Shopify private token thing during checkout, not our app).
