# üöÄ FEEDBACK LOOP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## ‚úÖ Current Status: Phase 1 Started

**Committed:** Pre-purchase attribution baseline (`bb2cfed`)

---

## üìã WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

### The Problem
- Recommendations served ‚úÖ
- Clicks tracked ‚úÖ
- BUT: No idea if they lead to sales ‚ùå
- BUT: No learning from performance ‚ùå
- Result: Merchants can't see ROI, recommendations don't improve

### The Solution
**3-Phase Feedback Loop:**
1. **Attribution** ‚Üí Know what converts
2. **Learning** ‚Üí Auto-improve from data  
3. **Application** ‚Üí Use insights in real-time

---

## üéØ PHASE 1: PURCHASE ATTRIBUTION (Days 1-3)

### Step 1: Webhook Handler ‚úÖ DONE
**File:** `app/routes/webhooks.orders.create.tsx`

**What it does:**
1. Receives order data when customer checks out
2. Extracts purchased product IDs
3. Looks up recommendations shown in last 7 days
4. Matches purchases to recommendations
5. Creates attribution records with revenue
6. Updates user profiles with purchase data

**Key Features:**
- 7-day attribution window
- Revenue tracking per product
- Conversion time tracking
- **Missed opportunity learning** (learns from what they bought INSTEAD)

---

### Step 2: Webhook Registration ‚úÖ DONE
**File:** `app/shopify.server.ts`

**Change:**
```typescript
webhooks: {
  ORDERS_CREATE: {
    deliveryMethod: DeliveryMethod.Http,
    callbackUrl: "/webhooks/orders/create",
  },
}
```

**Result:** Shopify will call our webhook every time an order is created.

---

### Step 3: Database Models ‚úÖ DONE
**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

**New Models:**

#### `RecommendationAttribution`
Tracks which recommendations led to actual sales.

Fields:
- `productId` - What was bought
- `orderId` - Which order
- `attributedRevenue` - $ from this product
- `conversionTimeMinutes` - How long from rec ‚Üí purchase
- `recommendationEventIds` - Links back to tracking events

#### `MLProductPerformance`
Daily aggregated performance metrics per product.

Fields:
- `impressions` - Times shown
- `clicks` - Times clicked
- `purchases` - Times bought
- `ctr` - Click-through rate
- `cvr` - Conversion rate
- `confidence` - Score 0-1 (used for filtering)
- `isBlacklisted` - Auto-flagged if consistently poor

---

### Step 4: Daily Learning Job ‚è≥ TODO
**File:** `app/jobs/daily-learning.server.ts` (to create)

**What it will do:**
1. Query last 30 days of data:
   - Tracking events (impressions/clicks)
   - Attribution records (purchases)
2. For each product, calculate:
   - CTR = clicks / impressions
   - CVR = purchases / impressions
   - Confidence = weighted score
3. Apply rules:
   - CVR < 0.5% after 100+ shows ‚Üí Blacklist
   - CVR > 2% ‚Üí Boost confidence
4. Update `MLProductPerformance` table

**Cron Schedule:** Daily at 2 AM

---

### Step 5: Apply Learning to Recommendations ‚è≥ TODO
**File:** `app/routes/apps.proxy.$.tsx` (modify ~line 900)

**What to add:**
```typescript
// Before returning recommendations...

// 1. Load performance data
const performance = await prisma.mLProductPerformance.findMany({
  where: { shop, productId: { in: candidateIds } }
});

// 2. Filter blacklisted
recommendations = recommendations.filter(rec => {
  const perf = performance.find(p => p.productId === rec.id);
  return !perf || !perf.isBlacklisted;
});

// 3. Adjust scores based on confidence
for (const rec of recommendations) {
  const perf = performance.find(p => p.productId === rec.id);
  if (perf) {
    if (perf.confidence > 0.7) rec.score *= 1.3; // 30% boost
    else if (perf.confidence < 0.3) rec.score *= 0.7; // 30% penalty
  }
}

// 4. Re-sort by adjusted scores
recommendations.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);
```

**Result:** Bad products automatically filtered, good ones promoted.

---

## üéØ PHASE 2: STRENGTHEN ML (Days 4-5)

### Step 6: Similarity Computation Job ‚è≥ TODO
**File:** `app/jobs/compute-similarities.server.ts` (to create)

**Purpose:** Fill `MLProductSimilarity` table with real co-purchase data

**Process:**
1. Fetch last 200 orders from Shopify
2. Build co-occurrence matrix:
   ```
   Product A bought with Product B: 45 times
   Product A bought with Product C: 23 times
   ```
3. Compute similarity scores:
   - Jaccard: intersection / union
   - Support: raw co-occurrence count
4. Store top 50 similar products per product

**Why:** Currently collaborative filtering is partially empty. This fills it with real store data.

---

### Step 7: User Profile Auto-Update ‚è≥ TODO
**File:** `app/services/user-profile.server.ts` (to create)

**Purpose:** Automatically update user profiles from tracking events

**Trigger Points:**
- Product viewed ‚Üí Add to `viewedProducts`
- Product clicked ‚Üí Add to `cartedProducts`  
- Order created (webhook) ‚Üí Add to `purchasedProducts`

**Why:** Personalization requires user history. Currently partially manual.

---

## üéØ PHASE 3: POLISH (Days 6-7)

### Step 8: Performance Monitoring ‚è≥ TODO
**File:** `app/jobs/health-check.server.ts` (to create)

**Alerts:**
- CVR drops below 0.5% ‚Üí Email alert
- Error rate spikes ‚Üí Slack notification
- No recommendations served in 24h ‚Üí Alert

---

4. ‚úÖ Impression/click tracking
5. ‚úÖ Basic dashboard structure

### What's MISSING (now being fixed):
1. ‚ùå Purchase attribution ‚Üí IMPLEMENTING NOW
2. ‚ùå Daily learning ‚Üí NEXT STEP
3. ‚ùå Auto-correction ‚Üí NEXT STEP

## üéØ SIMPLIFIED EXPLANATION

**Before (Current):**
```
Show recommendation ‚Üí Track impression ‚Üí Track click ‚Üí ??? 
(Never know if it led to sale)
```

**After (With Feedback Loop):**
```
Show recommendation ‚Üí Track impression ‚Üí Track click ‚Üí Track purchase ‚Üí Learn performance ‚Üí Adjust recommendations ‚Üí Better results
```

**Example:**
```
Day 1: Recommend iPhone Case (Score: 0.8)
Week 1: 100 shown, 3 clicked, 0 bought (CVR: 0%)
Week 2: Confidence drops to 0.2 ‚Üí System auto-reduces recommendations
Week 3: iPhone Case rarely shown anymore

Day 1: Recommend AirPods (Score: 0.8)
Week 1: 100 shown, 30 clicked, 15 bought (CVR: 15%)
Week 2: Confidence rises to 0.9 ‚Üí System auto-boosts recommendations
Week 3: AirPods shown 2x more often
```

**Result:** System learns which products actually sell and adjusts automatically.

## üìù TESTING CHECKLIST

### After Phase 1 Complete:
- [ ] Webhook receives order events
- [ ] Attribution records created in database
- [ ] Daily learning job runs successfully
- [ ] Bad products get blacklisted
- [ ] Good products get confidence boost
- [ ] Recommendations change based on performance

### Validation Queries:
```sql
-- Check attribution is working
SELECT * FROM recommendation_attributions WHERE shop = 'your-shop.myshopify.com' ORDER BY createdAt DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check learning is working
SELECT * FROM ml_product_performance WHERE shop = 'your-shop.myshopify.com' ORDER BY confidence DESC LIMIT 20;

-- Check blacklisting is working
SELECT * FROM ml_product_performance WHERE isBlacklisted = true;
```

---

## üéâ IMPACT PREDICTION

### Current State:
- Random recommendations
- No improvement over time
- Merchants can't see value
- High churn risk

### After Implementation:
- Smart recommendations (learn from sales)
- Auto-improvement daily
- Clear ROI visibility
- Retention boost

**Expected Improvements:**
- CVR: +0.5-1.0% (from optimization)
- Revenue/user: +15-25% (from better targeting)
- Merchant retention: +30-40% (from visible ROI)

---

**Status:** Phase 1 in progress. Webhook + schema ready. Next: Daily learning job + application logic.
