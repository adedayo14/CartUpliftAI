# Bundle & A/B Testing Fixes - October 2, 2025

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Bundle Management - Product Loading Stuck

**Problem**: Products stuck showing "Loading products..." spinner infinitely.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `isLoadingProducts` check was using `productFetcher.state === 'loading'`
- In Remix, fetcher states are only `'idle'` or `'submitting'`, never `'loading'`
- This caused the loading spinner to always show, even after products loaded

**Fix**:
```tsx
// Before (WRONG):
const isLoadingProducts = productFetcher.state === 'loading';

// After (CORRECT):
const isLoadingProducts = productFetcher.state !== 'idle';
```

**Result**: Products now load correctly and display with images and prices in the bundle creation modal.

### 2. A/B Testing - Duplicate Experiments & No Delete

**Problem**: 
- Duplicate experiments showing in table
- No way to delete old/test experiments
- Table looked messy with duplicate "Test Bundle Discount Experiment" entries

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Added Delete Functionality**:
   - Added "Actions" column to DataTable
   - Each row now has a "Delete" button
   - Delete button confirms before deletion
   - Uses JSON POST to `/api/ab-testing-admin` with `action: 'delete'`

2. **Improved Status Display**:
   - Changed from plain text to capitalized format
   - "draft" → "Draft", "active" → "Active", etc.

3. **Updated API Route**:
   - Added JSON request handling (previously only handled form data)
   - Added delete action handler:
     ```tsx
     if (action === 'delete') {
       await prisma.aBExperiment.delete({
         where: { id: experimentId }
       });
     }
     ```

**Result**: 
- Users can now delete duplicate/test experiments
- Clean table display with proper formatting
- Delete confirmation prevents accidental deletions

### A/B Testing

2. Verify you see your existing experiments in a table
