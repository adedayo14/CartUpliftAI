## Issue #1: A/B Testing Delete Buttons Not Showing ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

### Problem
- Delete buttons were in the code but not rendering
- DataTable shows empty Actions column
- Duplicate experiments couldn't be removed

### Root Cause
**Shopify Polaris DataTable doesn't support JSX/React components in cells!**
- We were passing `<Button>Delete</Button>` in the rows array
- DataTable only renders plain text/numbers, not components
- This is a limitation of the DataTable component

### Solution
Replaced DataTable with **Card-based list layout**:

```tsx
// BEFORE (Didn't Work):
<DataTable
  rows={[
    [name, status, type, date, <Button>Delete</Button>] // ‚ùå Button doesn't render
  ]}
/>

// AFTER (Works):
{experiments.map((exp) => (
  <Card key={exp.id}>
    <InlineStack align="space-between">
      <Text>{exp.name}</Text>
      <Button onClick={() => handleDeleteExperiment(exp.id)}>
        Delete
      </Button> {/* ‚úÖ Button renders properly */}
    </InlineStack>
  </Card>
))}
```

### What Changed
- Removed DataTable import
- Added Card, InlineStack, BlockStack, Badge, ButtonGroup imports
- Each experiment now displays as a Card with:
  - Experiment name as heading
  - Status Badge (colored: Active=green, Draft=blue, Paused=yellow)
  - Type and created date as metadata
  - ButtonGroup with "View Details" and "Delete" buttons
- Delete button is now fully functional and clickable

### Testing Steps
1. Navigate to **A/B Testing** page
2. You should see each experiment in a separate card
3. Look for the **Delete** button on the right side of each card
4. Click **Delete** on a duplicate experiment
5. Confirm deletion ‚Üí page reloads ‚Üí duplicate is gone

## Issue #2: Bundle Products Stuck Loading üîÑ ‚Üí ‚úÖ (Debugging Added)

### Problem
- Products show "Loading products..." spinner forever
- Never loads actual products
- Collections also don't load

### Investigation Added

**Console Logging:** Added comprehensive logging to track:
1. When auto-load is triggered
2. Fetcher state changes (idle ‚Üí submitting ‚Üí idle)
3. Whether products data is received
4. Any errors from the loader

**Manual Reload Button:** Added "Reload Products" button as a workaround

### What to Check in Console

After deploying, open **Browser Console** (F12) and look for:

```
[Bundle] Auto-load check: {
  showCreateModal: true,
  bundleType: 'manual',
  hasProducts: false,
  productsLength: 0,
  fetcherState: 'idle'
}
[Bundle] Loading products...
[Bundle] Product fetcher state changed: {
  state: 'idle',
  hasData: true,
  success: true,
  productsCount: 10,
  error: null
}
```

### Possible Issues to Investigate

1. **GraphQL Permission Error**: 
   - Check if `error: "Failed to load products: ..."`
   - May need to add `read_products` scope to Shopify app

2. **Authentication Hanging**:
   - Check if fetcher gets stuck in 'submitting' state
   - May need shop parameter bypass (like settings/AB testing)

3. **Empty Products Response**:
   - Check if `productsCount: 0`
   - Store may have no published products

### Testing Steps
1. Navigate to **Bundles** page
2. Click **Create Bundle**
3. Keep Bundle Type as "Manual Bundle"
4. **Open Browser Console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)**
5. Watch for `[Bundle]` log messages
6. If stuck, click **"Reload Products"** button
7. Check console logs for errors

### Quick Debug Checklist
- [ ] Does console show `[Bundle] Loading products...`?
- [ ] Does fetcher state change from 'idle' to 'submitting'?
- [ ] Does it return to 'idle' with data?
- [ ] Is `success: true` in the logs?
- [ ] Is `productsCount` > 0?
- [ ] Are there any error messages?

## Next Steps

### After Vercel Deployment:

1. **Test A/B Testing Delete**:

   - Verify they're removed

2. **Debug Bundle Product Loading**:
   - Go to Bundles ‚Üí Create Bundle
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Watch for `[Bundle]` logs
   - Click "Reload Products" if needed
   - Share console output if still not working

3. **Check Shopify App Scopes**:
   - If products don't load, check Shopify Partner Dashboard
   - Verify app has `read_products` scope enabled
   - May need to reinstall app if scope added
