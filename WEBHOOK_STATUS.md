# Webhook Status Summary - Oct 14, 2025

## ✅ Good News: Webhooks ARE Firing!

From Vercel logs at 12:11:23 and 12:16:28-29:
```
✅ Order webhook complete in 92ms
✅ Order webhook complete in 15ms  
✅ Order webhook complete in 73ms
```

## ⚠️ Some 401 Errors (Expected)

```
❌ Order webhook error: 401 Unauthorized
```

These 401 errors are likely:
1. Test webhook calls from Shopify (when you clicked "Send test notification")
2. Invalid HMAC signatures from testing
3. Webhook retries with expired signatures

## 🔍 Next Steps to Verify Attribution

1. **Click on a successful webhook log** (one that says "✅ Order webhook complete")
2. **Expand the "Messages" section** to see the full logs
3. **Look for these key messages:**
   - `📦 Processing order #[number]`
   - `Purchased product IDs: [...]`
   - `✅ Created attribution record for product [ID]`
   - `💰 Total attributed revenue: £[amount]`

4. **Check your dashboard** at:
   https://admin.shopify.com/store/sectionappblocks/apps/cartuplift-2
   
   - Refresh the page
   - Look at "Revenue from AI Recommendations"
   - Should show > £0.00 if attribution worked

## 📊 Understanding the Logs

- **Tracking events** (lots of `/apps/proxy/api/track` calls) = Recommendations being shown ✅
- **Webhook 200 responses** = Orders being received ✅  
- **Need to see:** Attribution creation messages in the expanded logs

## 🎯 Action Required
