# DIAGNOSIS: Why Forms Are Hanging

## Research Findings

Found EXACT issue on GitHub: https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/issues/795

**Title:** "Form POST requests failing when authenticate.admin is called"

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Session Token Issues
The GitHub issue shows this error:
```
Failed to validate session token: Failed to parse session token 'undefined': Invalid Compact JWS
```

This means the session token is not being passed correctly from the iframe to the server.

### 2. Must Return Values
Comment from TheGreatSimo:
> "try to use useSubmit from Remix to submit to an action function **and also return something from the action function**. If you don't need any data **just return null**"

✅ We ARE returning values - so this isn't the issue

### 3. React Hydration Errors
Multiple instances of React error #418 - server HTML doesn't match client
- ✅ FIXED: Removed `process.env` from client components

## Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ App loads
- ✅ Pages render
- ✅ Buttons exist
- ✅ JavaScript runs partially
- ✅ Console logs show button clicks start

### What's NOT Working
- ❌ POST requests never reach the action function
- ❌ `authenticate.admin(request)` may be failing silently
- ❌ React hydration still causing issues (error #418 still appearing)

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Check Session Token Passing
The issue might be that the session token isn't being passed in the request headers.

**Test:** Check if `request.headers` contains the authorization token

### Option 2: Vercel-Specific Issue
Vercel might be stripping headers or blocking iframe POST requests

**Test:** Try deploying to a different platform (Railway, Render, Fly.io)

### Option 3: App Bridge Configuration
The App Bridge might not be correctly configured for the iframe

**Test:** Check if `shopify.app.toml` settings match Vercel deployment URL

### Option 4: CORS / CSP Headers
Cross-origin or Content Security Policy headers might be blocking requests

**Test:** Check response headers in Network tab

## Next Steps

1. **Check if request reaches Vercel at all**
   - Look at Vercel logs
   - Add logging BEFORE `authenticate.admin()`

2. **Bypass authentication temporarily**
   - Create action WITHOUT `authenticate.admin()`
   - See if POST works at all

3. **Check shopify.app.toml**
   - Verify `application_url` matches Vercel URL exactly
   - Verify scopes are correct

4. **Check environment variables on Vercel**
   - Ensure all SHOPIFY_* vars are set correctly
   - Especially `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`

## Critical Question

**Does the POST request even reach Vercel?**
- If YES → Authentication is failing
- If NO → Routing/CORS/CSP issue
