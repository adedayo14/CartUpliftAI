## 🎯 WHAT CHANGED

### Before (Expandable Rows - Just Implemented 8 mins ago):
```
Order    Customer Spent  Added from AI  AI Impact  Products
#1044    £1,636.90      £749.95        [46%]      [3 items ▼]  ← Click to expand
  
  Products from recommendations:
  • The Letterman
  • Snow Boots
  • Calf Sole Sneakers
```

**Problems:**
- ⚠️ Table grows vertically when expanded
- ⚠️ Pushes other content down
- ⚠️ Can expand multiple orders = very long table

---

### After (Modal Popup):
```
Order    Customer Spent  Added from AI  AI Impact  Products
#1044    £1,636.90      £749.95        [46%]      [3 items →]  ← Click opens modal

## 🎯 AOV DISPLAY (Already Perfect!)

### Hero Card Shows AOV:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Revenue from AI Recommendations          │
│                                          │
│ £749.95                                  │
│ 15.3x ROI                                │
│ £49.00 app cost                          │
│                                          │
│ 1 orders with AI recommendations         │
│ Average order value: £749.95             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Already shows:**
- ✅ Total revenue from recommendations
- ✅ Number of orders
- ✅ **Average order value** ← Already there!

**No need to add:**
- ❌ Separate AOV comparison card (would be redundant)
- ❌ Items per cart metric (not as valuable as AOV)

**Current display is perfect because:**
1. Shows AOV right in the hero card (most important spot)
2. ROI metric already shows value per dollar spent
3. "Biggest Wins" table shows individual order values
