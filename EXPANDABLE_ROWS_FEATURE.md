**Date:** October 15, 2025 - 1:52 PM  
**Commit:** `ab01889`  
**Status:** ✅ Deployed to Vercel

---

## 🎯 WHAT CHANGED

### Before (Horizontal Scrolling):
```
Order  Customer Spent  Added from AI  AI Impact  What They Added
#1044  £1,636.90      £749.95        46%        3 items: The Letterman, Snow Boots, Ca... [scroll →]
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Had to scroll horizontally to see all products
- ❌ "What They Added" column was truncated
- ❌ Couldn't see all products at once

---

### After (Expandable Rows):
```
Order    Customer Spent  Added from AI  AI Impact  Products
#1044    £1,636.90      £749.95        46%        [3 items ▼]
  └─ Products from recommendations:
     • The Letterman
     • Snow Boots
     • Calf Sole Sneakers
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No horizontal scrolling
- ✅ All products visible when expanded
- ✅ Clean, organized view
- ✅ Works on mobile & desktop

---

## 🎨 HOW IT WORKS

### Collapsed State (Default):
- Shows summary: "3 items" with down arrow (▼)
- Compact view shows key metrics
- Click to expand and see details

### Expanded State:
- Shows full product list with bullets
- Each product on its own line
- Click again to collapse
- Visual feedback (hover state)

### For Single Item Orders:
- No expand button (nothing to expand)
- Shows: "1 item: The Letterman"
- Simple, clean display

---

## 💎 VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS

### Color-Coded AI Impact Badges:
- 🟢 **Green** badge: ≥50% AI impact (High impact!)
- 🟡 **Yellow** badge: 30-49% AI impact (Good impact)
- 🔵 **Blue** badge: <30% AI impact (Some impact)

### Row Interactions:
- **Hover effect:** Subtle background change
- **Expanded row:** Different background to show active state
- **Smooth animation:** 200ms expand/collapse transition

---

## 📱 RESPONSIVE DESIGN

### Desktop (Wide Screen):
```
┌────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────┬──────────┬────────────┐
│ Order  │ Customer Spent  │ Added from AI│ AI Impact│ Products   │
├────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────┼──────────┼────────────┤
│ #1044  │ £1,636.90       │ £749.95     │ [46%]    │ [3 items ▼]│
│        │ Products from recommendations:              │
│        │ • The Letterman                             │
│        │ • Snow Boots                                │
│        │ • Calf Sole Sneakers                        │
└────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────┴──────────┴────────────┘
```

### Mobile (Narrow Screen):
- Columns stack naturally (Polaris handles this)
- Expand button stays functional
- Touch-friendly targets
- No horizontal scrolling

---

## 🧑‍💻 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### State Management:
```typescript
const [expandedOrders, setExpandedOrders] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

const toggleOrder = (orderNumber: string) => {
  setExpandedOrders(prev => {
    const newSet = new Set(prev);
    if (newSet.has(orderNumber)) {
      newSet.delete(orderNumber); // Collapse
    } else {
      newSet.add(orderNumber); // Expand
    }
    return newSet;
  });
};
```

### UI Components Used:
- **Collapsible:** Smooth expand/collapse animation
- **Button (disclosure):** Expand/collapse trigger with arrow icon
- **Badge:** Color-coded AI impact percentage
- **BlockStack/InlineStack:** Shopify Polaris layout components
- **Box:** Background colors and padding

### Accessibility:
- ✅ Keyboard accessible (Tab + Enter to expand)
- ✅ Screen reader friendly (disclosure button)
- ✅ Clear visual states (expanded/collapsed)
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure
